## 🧩 Overview  

**MAPS** is a computational framework for testing whether visual explanations from deep neural networks capture human-like and primate-like visual strategies.  
The repository provides all scripts and notebooks to:  
- 🧠 Fine-tune models on an object-recognition dataset  
- 🌈 Generate attribution maps and **Explanation-Manipulated Inputs (EMIs)**  
- 📊 Compute behavioral metrics (**B.I1**) and correlations with humans, monkeys, and neurons  
- 🔍 Compare attribution methods and assess explanation similarity (L1, L2, LPIPS)  
- 📈 Reproduce all figures and analyses from the MAPS paper  

Precomputed data and psychophysics datasets are publicly hosted on the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/t6kw8/).

## ⚙️ Installation  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vital-kolab/maps.git
cd maps
conda create -n maps python=3.10
conda activate maps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

GPU acceleration (CUDA) is recommended for attribution generation.

## 🚀 Quickstart Pipeline  

### **1️⃣ Fine-tune models**
Train the selected architectures on your dataset:

```bash
python finetune_models.py
```

- By default, the script uses the dataset in `./coco200/`.  
- To use your own data, change `"coco200"` to your dataset folder name.

---

### **2️⃣ Select the best model**
Determine which model best matches human behavior:

```bash
jupyter notebook get_best_model.ipynb
```

- To use your own human data, place your files in:  
  ```
  behavioral_responses/humans/
  ```

---

### **3️⃣ Generate explanations**
Compute attribution maps for your model:

```bash
python get_attributions_gpu.py --model_name convnext --method_name NoiseTunnel_Saliency
```

You can replace `convnext` with the best model assessed above and `NoiseTunnel_Saliency` with any Captum method.

---

### **4️⃣ Generate EMIs (Explanation-Manipulated Inputs)**
Perturb images based on attribution maps:

```bash
python generate_emis.py convnext NoiseTunnel_Saliency
```

As above, you can replace `convnext` with the best model assessed above and `NoiseTunnel_Saliency` with any Captum method.

---

### **5️⃣ Compute behavioral metrics (B.I1)**
Evaluate model behavior on EMIs:

```bash
python generate_i1s.py convnext NoiseTunnel_Saliency
```
This produces per-image behavioral vectors used to compare models, humans, and monkeys.

As above, you can replace `convnext` with the best model assessed above and `NoiseTunnel_Saliency` with any Captum method.

---

### **6️⃣ Compare models, humans, and monkeys**
Use the provided notebooks for main analyses:

| Notebook | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `compare_explanations.ipynb` | Evaluate accuracy and correlations between models and humans, and compare against baseline explanations (bubbles, object-only). |
| `compare_explanations_with_monkeys.ipynb` | Compare model and monkey behavior under equivalent conditions. |

---

### **(Optional) Identify the best attribution method**
Generate Explanations, EMIs and Behavioral metrics for all explanation methods and all models, then run:

```
get_best_method.ipynb
```

This notebook identifies the attribution method that leads to the highest reference-target alignment on average across models.

---

## 📚 Additional Analyses  

Reproduce all extended results and figures from the paper:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| `compare_similarities.ipynb` | Compare L1, L2, and LPIPS similarity between explanation maps. |
| `get_ground_truth.ipynb` | Compute ground-truth similarity between pairs of models. |
| `compare_ground_truth_proxy.ipynb` | Compare behavioral proxy correlations with ground-truth explanation similarity. |
| `test_models.ipynb` | Compute B.I1 scores for all models on clean images. |
| `compare_neural_predictions.ipynb` | Compare IT neural predictions for the best and worst explanation methods. |
